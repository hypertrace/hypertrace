## This does everything you need to get a hypertracing system started.
## You can connect to the UI at port 2020 and send data to it on any supported tracing solution.
## Note: Our stack is dependent on pinot and it is a cpu heavy during startup.
## The depends_on has a max wait time of 1 min, so if you don't have enough resources, you may have to re-run the same command.
## we are looking at improving this.
