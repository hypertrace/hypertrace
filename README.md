# Hypertrace

Hypertrace is a cloud-native distributed tracing based Observability platform
that gives visibility into your dev and production distributed systems.

Hypertrace was originally developed by Traceable as a highly scalable
distributed tracing platform and it is used by Traceable’s cloud-native
application security platform. ‍Realizing that Hypertrace was a powerful
standalone tracing and observability platform, Traceable created this open source
project for the software development community to use in their applications.

## Quick-start

If you want to see Hypertrace in action, you can quickly start Hypertrace.

### Requirements:
- [docker-engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (17.12.0+)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (1.21.0 +)
- **We recommend you change the [Docker Desktop default settings](https://hypertrace-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/docker-desktop.png) from `2 GB` of memory to `4 GB` of memory, and set CPUs to at least 4 CPUs.** 
`Note`: When reporting problems, please include the output of `docker stats --no-stream`.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/hypertrace/hypertrace.git
cd hypertrace/docker
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

This will start all services required for Hypertrace. Once you see the service `Hypertrace-UI` start, you can visit the UI at http://localhost:2020.

If your application is already instrumented to send traces to Zipkin or Jaeger, it will work with Hypertrace.

If not, you can try Hypertrace with our sample application by running

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin-example.yml up
```

the sample app will run at http://localhost:8081. You should request the URL a few times to generate some sample trace requests!

## Deploying with Kubernetes

Please refer to the [deployments](https://docs.hypertrace.org/deployments/) section in our documentation which lists the steps to deploy Hypertrace on different Kubernetes flavors across different operating systems and cloud providers. You can find the Helm Charts and installation scripts with more details [here](/kubernetes).
